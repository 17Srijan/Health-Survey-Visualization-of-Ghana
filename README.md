# Health-Survey-Visualization-of-Ghana
### Description
The project was a health survey done in Ghana, here multiple questions were asked to the survey participants, i took a few important demographic data and tried to create visualizations based on it.
### Objectives
The following were the objectives of the project:
- Take 5 important headings and create visuals based on them.
- To check whether food expenses vary based on employment status and gender.
- to see the median and mean ages of people based on gender.
- to see the median and mean ages of people in different employment statuses.
- to plot based on the location data of the survey participants.
### Data cleaning and Preparation 
- Filtered the unnecessary heads of the data, and selected the best suitable.
- Changed the names of the headings to understand the data better.
- Removed big outliers in the Food expenses (based on Gender) plot to make the plot understandable.
- Using Groupby for creating plots of Different Genders based on Different employment status 
- Imported maps to create the plot of Ghana, and then based on the location of survey participants created more comprehensive map plots
### Analysis and Insights
- The mean and median ages of male and female gender are approximately the same.
- The mean age of people Employed Part-time and full-time are the same & Retired people have the highest mean age which is very logical.
- The count of Females in both Employed (Full-time) & (Part-time) is more than Males but so are Unemployed counts.
- We can observe that the earning capacity of the *Other* Gender might be low because of Lower Median food expenses, but we cannot conclude that there might be discrimination as the dataset only includes 2 people of the *Other* Gender.
- Median Food expenses of Homemaker is the highest
- Based on the scatter plot, we observe that the food expenses might be quite similar for every gender and age but actually, the plot is misleading because of the huge outliers the plot starts from 0-2000 which is already a huge difference between the data points.
### Conclusion
- This was my first hands-on experience of creating visuals based on data.
- My biggest learning is how to choose the most suitable categories to understand and make sense of the data.
